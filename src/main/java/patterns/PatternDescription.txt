Visitor design pattern is one of the behavioral design patterns.
It is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects.
With the help of patterns.visitorPattern pattern, we can move the operational logic from the objects to another class.

Advantages :
If the logic of operation changes, then we need to make change only in the patterns.visitorPattern implementation rather than doing it in all the item classes.
Adding a new item to the system is easy, it will require change only in patterns.visitorPattern interface and implementation and existing item classes will not be affected.

Disadvantages :
We should know the return type of visit() methods at the time of designing otherwise we will have to change the interface and all of its implementations.
If there are too many implementations of patterns.visitorPattern interface, it makes it hard to extend.
